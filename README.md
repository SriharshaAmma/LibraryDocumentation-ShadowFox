## 🧠 Introduction

Data visualization is essential for making sense of large datasets. Python offers flexible tools to turn raw data into beautiful, insightful charts.

This repo includes:
- Code examples for **line**, **bar**, **pie**, **scatter**, **histogram**, **box**, **heatmap**, and **multi-line** plots.
- Side-by-side usage of Matplotlib (for precision) and Seaborn (for elegance).
